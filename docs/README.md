# Microphone Status Overlay
Windows 11 program that overlays the toggle mute status of your microphone for each hotkey

## Getting Started
Open `Microphone Status Overlay.vbs` and click `Yes` in the imports installer screen.

## Usage
For each program you would like the microphone status to be overlayed, load an icon and set the hotkey used by the program.

Press `Start Overlay` to start the overlay, `Stop Overlay` to stop the overlay, and the close button to exit the GUI. 

You are able to modify the size, location, and status of the icons within the GUI.

Feel free to create a shortcut to the VBS file for easy access in the start menu or desktop.
